# ASSIGNMENT Webpack Practice

Make 5 repos, one a day, from the [webpack template](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/webpack-template). At the end you should be able to `npm start` and see your background changed, a h1 with a message, and a console.error() in the console. This is our New Setup, so practice is important. Just like what you did with the old repos, but this time following the steps on the template.
